## Document policy

This is the only normative architecture and roadmap document.

- [README.md](README.md) documents current installation, commands, and
  operator-facing behavior.
- `eval/` contains dated protocols, preregistrations, and results. Those files
  are historical evidence, not live plans, and should not be rewritten to match
  later decisions.
- `presentations/` contains dated explanatory artifacts. Presentations are not
  implementation specifications or review material and should not be revised
  unless Cristian explicitly requests presentation work.
- Superseded plans and critiques remain available through Git history; keeping
  copies in the working tree created contradictory status and requirements.

When code and this document disagree about current behavior, fix the document
or code explicitly. Do not add another competing plan.

## Product

jscout is persistent, verifiable repository memory for coding agents. It is a
complementary tool: agents still reason, inspect source, and make changes;
jscout makes repository evidence and previously established meaning cheaper to
retrieve across files and sessions.

The serving contract is:

> Given an agent's current query or focus, return the smallest trustworthy
> slice of repository evidence that improves its next action.

The graph is structural infrastructure, not the product by itself. Scouting
uses deterministic repository structure to bound model interpretation, then
stores only evidence-backed semantic claims with visible confidence and
freshness.

## Trust model

| Layer | Contents | Authority and freshness |
|---|---|---|
| **R0 — source** | Repository files and exact indexed content | Final authority |
| **R1 — deterministic facts** | Files, symbols, resolved references, modules, contracts, runtime entities, occurrences, and structural edges | Parser/resolver/extractor output; refreshed by indexing |
| **R2 — derived views** | Search hits, definitions, outlines, neighborhoods, paths, repository overview, and optional elided source | Rendered from one current SQLite snapshot; not semantic truth |
| **R3 — semantic memory** | Workflows, annotations, selected symbol cards, summaries, and concepts | Model- or agent-authored claims; fingerprinted, evidence-backed, confidence-limited, and freshness-labelled |

Only deterministic resolution may be `certain`. Model- and agent-authored
claims are capped at `likely`; incomplete interpretations are `possible`.
Semantic artifacts are returned as `fresh`, `degraded`, `stale`, or
`superseded` rather than silently presented as current truth.

## Non-negotiable invariants

1. Raw source is never replaced by a compressed or generated representation.
2. Rust owns repository access, deterministic candidates, evidence packs,
   schemas, validation, persistence, freshness, and public CLI/MCP behavior.
3. Generative providers are reached only through the companion pi-ai gateway;
   the JavaScript process never receives repository or SQLite access.
4. Existing typed extraction tables are canonical. Generic graph tables are
   disposable traversal projections.
5. Chunks are retrieval units, not ontology nodes. Search hits project onto
   snapshot-scoped file and symbol anchors.
6. Ambiguity produces candidates, hubs, or a loud error—never silent omission
   or fabricated certainty.
7. Every semantic claim reaches exact source evidence directly or through
   fingerprinted child artifacts.
8. Indexing and watch mode never make model calls or spend model budget.
9. Complete response budgets include hits, semantic memory, expansion,
   metadata, and serialization overhead.
10. Dependency internals, possible-confidence expansion, and structural
    expansion remain explicit scope choices.

## System architecture

```text
agent / CLI / MCP
        |
        v
Rust jscout
  walk + parse + resolve + extract
        |
        v
SQLite R0 references + R1 facts + graph projection
        |
        +--> deterministic R2 retrieval and agent surfaces
        |
        +--> candidate/evidence pack --> Node pi-ai gateway --> model
                                            |
                                            v
                              Rust validation + atomic R3 publication
```

Rust remains the application. The gateway is a transport adapter, not an
agent, indexer, or semantic authority.

## Implemented baseline

| Area | Current implementation |

| Storage | One versioned SQLite database; schema v14; FTS5, embeddings, canonical extraction tables, graph projection, semantic artifacts, run ledger, and freshness metadata |
| Runtime graph | Files, symbols, imports/exports/re-exports, module resolution, local/imported references, calls, construction, JSX renders, inheritance, event/property hubs, and ranked bounded traversal |
| Runtime boundaries | Registry handlers/dispatch, lifecycle operations/listeners, jobs/queues/crons, DI tokens/providers, and logical workflow handoffs |
| Contract plane | Interfaces, aliases, enums, decorators, DTO/schema evidence, exported parameter/return contracts, referenced contract names, and type-only barrel resolution; documentary edges remain separate from runtime edges |
| General entities | Routes, GraphQL operations, environment/configuration keys, database resources, feature flags, and external-service hosts with canonical identity plus evidence-bearing occurrences |
| Dependency scope | Opt-in named packages; realpath-normalized workspace/dependency identity, pnpm layout/version handling, source-over-dist preference, bundle/minification limits, and dependency origin excluded from retrieval by default |
| Retrieval | BM25 plus optional embeddings/RRF/reranking; snapshot-scoped anchors, file roles, definitions, who-uses, events, entity lookup, repository overview, ranked paths, semantic-memory attachment, and opt-in structural expansion |
| Agent integration | CLI, MCP profiles, project-local agent guide, response budgets, privacy-minimal telemetry, and isolated evaluation database support |
| Semantic memory | Validated agent write-back; candidate-closed generated workflows; automatic deterministic seeds; run reuse; explicit refresh; immutable successors; fresh/degraded/stale status |
| Model gateway | `@earendil-works/pi-ai` 0.84.1 sidecar, protocol-v1 JSONL over stdio, provider/auth registry, cancellation, normalized usage/errors, and `llm doctor` |

## Deterministic repository plane

### Identity and resolution

Canonical anchors are snapshot-scoped:

- `file:<repo-relative-path>`
- `pkg:<package-name>`
- `sym:<path>#<scope>::<name>@<ordinal>`
- `contract:<entity-type>:<path>#<name>` for contract declarations;
  name-only contract references collapse to hashed
  `contract:<entity-type>:ref-<digest>` hubs, and requests that leave the
  indexed tree use the `contract:<entity-type>:external:<request>#<name>`
  and `contract:<entity-type>:unresolved:<request>#<name>` variants
- `entity:<type>:<normalized-name>` for canonical entities, with hashed
  `entity:<type>:ref-<digest>` reference hubs
- receiver-qualified or unknown event/property hubs

They are deterministic for one indexed snapshot, not stable identities across
arbitrary edits or moves. Responses carry the repository snapshot. A stale
symbol anchor is re-resolved by path, scope, and name; ambiguity fails with
candidates rather than binding to a reused ordinal.

After changed files are extracted, jscout rebuilds the disposable graph
projection in one transaction. Full projection rebuild remains the policy
because a barrel edit can reroute unchanged importers. Selective invalidation
is not justified until measured scale requires it.

Chunks project onto overlapping declaration anchors and fall back to the file
for module-level behavior. The originating hit remains attached so traversal
never loses its exact source context.

### Uncertain runtime relationships

- Ambiguous root references fan out as `possible` candidate edges.
- Unknown-receiver member calls use bounded property hubs rather than a
  call-site × symbol cross-product.
- Events use receiver-qualified or unknown event hubs; jscout does not connect
  every emitter to every listener sharing a common string.
- General-association edges are terminal and degree-bounded in workflow
  traversal so common helpers do not consume the candidate budget.

Every projected edge retains kind, confidence, provenance, source location,
and detail needed to explain why it exists.

### Runtime, contract, and entity planes

The runtime plane models executable values and effects. The contract plane
retains TypeScript and schema information as documentary evidence without
pretending it is a runtime call edge. Canonical entities remain separate from
their source occurrences so identity, provenance, evidence, and file lifecycle
have the correct update semantics.

Runtime-boundary and general entities are projected into the graph. This lets
an agent traverse relationships such as route → handler → service → queue →
worker or producer → data resource → lifecycle listener, including across
repository/dependency boundaries when dependency origin is explicitly enabled.

### Dependency boundary

`jscout index --deps <package,...>` indexes named installed packages only.
Blanket `node_modules` indexing is intentionally unsupported because it
amplifies irrelevant-file noise and bundled/minified content.

Physical identity wins over traversal spelling:

- realpaths inside the repository are workspace code even when reached through
  `node_modules` symlinks;
- pnpm store realpaths are deduplicated and versioned from their package
  instance;
- dependency files carry `origin=dependency` plus package identity;
- dependency chunks and backing files stay excluded from default retrieval;
- Yarn Plug'n'Play zip indexing is out of scope.

### Retrieval and traversal

Search ranking is independent of graph expansion. Expansion attaches a
separately labelled structural context pack after retrieval and remains off by
default. Matching semantic memory is attached by default with explicit
freshness and can be disabled or separately budgeted.

Traversal uses a simple, explicit ranking hypothesis:

```text
path score = minimum confidence on the path
           × relation weight
           × distance decay
           × hub damping
           × file-role/origin policy
```

The weights are deterministic heuristics, not learned relevance. Nodes and
edges are deduplicated before global node, edge, and byte budgets are applied.
Standalone neighborhood UX is secondary; expanded search and bounded paths are
the primary graph delivery surfaces agents have actually used.

## Semantic scouting plane

### Gateway boundary

The gateway is a companion Node package using pi-ai. It owns provider
registration, model lookup, credentials, reasoning/service-tier translation,
request execution, cancellation, and normalized provider errors/usage. It does
not own prompts, schemas, tools, repository reads, validation, or persistence.

Resolution order is:

1. CLI override;
2. `JSCOUT_*` environment override;
3. bundled gateway and the plan-backed model default
   `openai-codex:gpt-5.6-terra`.

There is no automatic provider, model, or billing-path fallback. Diagnostics
and every scout run record provider, model, billing path, reasoning policy,
gateway protocol, prompt version, usage, and stable error classification.
Credentials and hidden reasoning are never stored.

The operator configuration surface — `JSCOUT_LLM_MODEL`,
`JSCOUT_LLM_REASONING`, `JSCOUT_PI_AI_GATEWAY`, `JSCOUT_NODE`, and the
gateway-side `JSCOUT_PI_AI_AUTH_FILE` and
`JSCOUT_PI_AI_OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `JSCOUT_PI_AI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_PROVIDERS`
— is documented in the README
configuration section, with `.env.example` as the safe template. This
document defines the boundary; the README owns the operating instructions.

The versioned JSONL protocol uses request IDs and supports `hello`,
capabilities, completion, cancellation, and shutdown. Rust submits one JSON
Schema tool per semantic artifact type. Text-only output, unknown/multiple tool
calls, malformed arguments, incomplete candidate classification, timeouts, and
unexpected gateway exit fail the run without publishing an artifact.

### Storage and publication

`semantic_artifacts` and `semantic_supports` are canonical semantic memory.
Generated rows also reference `scout_runs`, input/artifact fingerprints, and
exhaustive `scout_classifications`. `semantic_relations` links parent artifacts
to fingerprinted children for hierarchy and concepts.

A generated artifact is published only when one transaction can commit the
completed run, classifications, artifact, supports, and relations after
rechecking the current snapshot and evidence hashes. Failed, incomplete,
canceled, or snapshot-raced runs publish no artifact.

Agent `annotate` writes use the same support validation and freshness rules but
cannot modify structural tables. Agent-reported claims and generated claims
remain separately attributable and corrections create immutable successors.

### Implemented workflow scouting (G1–G5)

1. Resolve explicit seeds or deterministically select entry surfaces from
   routes, GraphQL, runtime handlers/producers, lifecycle/job/DI boundaries,
   and bounded package/application exports.
2. Construct a ranked, bounded workflow candidate set from the current graph.
   Truncated sets are refused rather than interpreted as complete.
3. Build a line-numbered evidence pack from full source plus relevant
   deterministic entities. Contract-only relationships stay out of runtime
   workflow topology.
4. Fingerprint the snapshot, seeds, candidates, evidence, schema, prompt,
   gateway protocol, model, and request policy. Reuse a matching completed run
   unless rebuild is explicit.
5. Require the model to classify every candidate exactly once as `defining`,
   `supporting`, or `excluded`, with roles and exact evidence for included
   candidates.
6. Validate closure, anchors, line ranges, hashes, body limits, confidence, and
   at least one defining participant in Rust.
7. Recheck all deterministic inputs and publish atomically. Refresh selects
   stale/degraded current workflows and writes immutable successors using their
   recorded configuration.

The model cannot add anchors outside the deterministic candidate set. It may
declare the pack incomplete; that records an incomplete run and publishes no
workflow.

## Remaining semantic-v1 roadmap

### G6 — selected symbol cards (next)

Generate cards only for exported symbols, entity endpoints, workflow
participants, and explicitly requested anchors. Reuse the gateway, run ledger,
evidence pack, support validator, freshness engine, and immutable supersession.

Cards may describe purpose, architectural role, domain terms, side effects,
invariants, and failure modes. They must not spend model tokens restating
signatures or deterministic calls. Every individual claim needs exact support;
unsupported optional fields are omitted rather than filled speculatively.

Required engineering work:

- versioned card schema and submit tool;
- deterministic selection and `--dry-run` planning;
- bounded evidence focused on the selected symbol and direct structural
  context;
- claim-level support validation and artifact fingerprinting;
- reuse, refresh, cancellation, snapshot-race, and no-partial-write coverage.

### G7 — hierarchical summaries

Build bottom-up rather than prompting over the repository at once:

- file summaries from validated cards/workflows plus deterministic topology;
- module/package summaries from selected child claims;
- repository summary from package/module artifacts.

Every parent claim links through `semantic_relations` to child fingerprints and
ultimately to exact source support. A changed child degrades or stales its
parents even when the parent's own text is unchanged. Prose without a support
chain is not indexable memory.

### G8 — concepts

Infer concepts from validated workflow/card vocabulary, not from embedding
clusters and not by tagging every chunk with a separate model call.

- store normalized name, aliases, definition, linked artifacts, and supports;
- auto-merge exact normalized aliases only;
- keep ambiguous near-duplicates separate until a validated merge proposal;
- derive file/chunk tags through evidence overlap;
- confidence-limit concept relations and fingerprint all dependencies.

This layer enables questions such as “which workflows touch invoice
reconciliation?” without replacing the source evidence used to answer them.

### G9 — retrieval, packaging, and operations

- semantic-specific CLI/MCP queries for workflows, cards, concepts, related
  artifacts, freshness, and exact source drill-down;
- deterministic repository overview with optional fresh semantic overlays;
- bounded result sections rather than mixing prose into code ranking;
- gateway packaging beside release binaries, supported Node-version checks,
  and clear missing-runtime diagnostics;
- documentation for Codex-plan auth, API providers, custom compatible
  endpoints, proxy/TLS behavior, redaction, cancellation, and retries;
- bounded retries only for classified transient/capacity failures; no hidden
  provider, model, service-tier, or billing fallback.

## Semantic-v1 completion boundary

Semantic v1 is complete when:

- one supported installation can call both a ChatGPT-plan model and an API-key
  model through the same gateway protocol;
- workflows, selected cards, hierarchy, and concepts all use the common
  run/evidence/freshness engine;
- malformed, partial, unsupported, or snapshot-raced output never publishes;
- stale artifacts are visibly stale and refresh into immutable successors;
- semantic-specific queries and repository overview drill down to exact source;
- the gateway is bundled, diagnosable, cancellable, and redacts credentials and
  prompt contents from normal logs;
- deterministic indexing and retrieval still work with Node absent.

## Verification policy

No further product-value evaluation is required before G6–G9. Implementation
work still requires engineering verification:

- Rust compile, formatting, lint, unit, migration, and existing regression
  tests;
- fake-provider gateway protocol/config/auth tests;
- schema rejection, cancellation, timeout, child-crash, snapshot-race, and
  no-partial-write tests;
- deterministic evidence-pack and freshness-transition fixtures;
- no paid or plan-backed model calls in the default test suite.

After semantic v1, run real Sol or Terra scouting on the installed n8n and
Twenty repositories, inspect generated memory, repair implementation defects,
and only then compare real agent work with and without it.

## Evaluation decisions already made

The dated evidence remains under `eval/`; this section records only the design
consequences that still govern implementation.

| Finding | Current consequence |
|---|---|
| Unassisted Codex sessions made zero jscout calls; MCP metadata alone did not create adoption | Ship explicit project-local agent guidance; do not generalize the adoption result to every client/model |
| Grep, baseline, and structural arms reached the same correctness ceiling while structural retrieval initially read more irrelevant files | L1 retrieval investment is closed; expansion stays opt-in and file-role/origin policy applies before budgets |
| Whole search responses grew materially when structural context was attached | Complete rendered-response byte budgets are a permanent contract |
| The preregistered file-role revision reduced structural irrelevant inspection to an interval including zero without creating a correctness win | Keep deterministic role classification/filtering; do not claim graph value from the result |
| Full versus elided source retained answer quality but did not reduce selected-artifact bytes/calls | Full source remains the default; custom behavioral IR is not earned |
| Fixed-snapshot workflow memory replay delivered artifacts in every correct warm token win and reduced median session-2 tokens | Keep evidence-backed workflow memory opt-in and proceed with the shared semantic engine |
| Free-form workflow participant synthesis omitted deterministic continuations | Candidate closure and exhaustive classification are mandatory |
| Standalone `neighborhood` had no natural selection while expanded search used the same machinery | Treat neighborhood as drill-down plumbing; prioritize agent-reached surfaces |

## Positioning versus tsserver/LSP

jscout does not compete with a configured TypeScript language server on typed
definition/call hierarchy, diagnostics, rename/refactor safety, or precise
interface-to-implementation navigation. Agents should use an LSP for those
operations when it is available and healthy.

jscout provides a different repository-level surface:

- one runtime-oriented model across JavaScript and TypeScript;
- explicit candidates for the dynamic tail an LSP cannot prove;
- entities, dependency boundaries, and cross-file workflow paths;
- bounded snapshot-labelled context for agent consumption;
- persistent evidence-backed semantic and agent memory across sessions.

Do not reimplement checker machinery speculatively. Optional tsserver
enrichment is deferred until missing checker-backed edges are a measured agent
failure and its monorepo/runtime cost is justified.

## Deferred or out of scope

- cross-edit stable symbol identity;
- runtime traces;
- checker-backed enrichment before the LSP revisit trigger;
- learned compression or learned traversal policy;
- LLM-generated pseudocode as source truth;
- one model call per chunk;
- embedding clusters presented as domain concepts;
- semantic claims modifying deterministic structural facts;
- hidden model spending during index/watch;
- autonomous tool-using agents inside the gateway;
- automatic provider/model/billing fallback;
- migrating embeddings through pi-ai;
- blanket dependency indexing;
- Yarn Plug'n'Play dependency archive indexing.

## Retained decision rationale

| Decision | Reason | Revisit trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Keep chunks out of graph identity | Chunk boundaries follow retrieval budgets and churn independently of repository identity | A concrete query needs chunk identity independent of source anchors |
| Rebuild the graph projection after indexing | Barrel edits can reroute unchanged importers; full rebuild is simpler and correct at current scale | A measured repository exceeds the acceptable projection budget |
| Use hubs/candidates for uncertain dynamic relationships | Direct pairing creates false edges and quadratic fan-out | Receiver identity can be resolved deterministically |
| Separate entities from occurrences | Canonical identity and evidence sites have different lifecycle/provenance semantics | No planned revisit |
| Keep structural expansion off by default | Evaluation did not show a default-workload outcome gain and simple lookups do not need graph context | Real agent work shows a reliable default benefit |
| Treat traversal weights as heuristics | Published systems do not validate jscout's edge kinds, confidence mapping, or workload | Repository-specific evidence supports tuning or learning |
| Keep generated semantics separate from structural facts | Model interpretation can be useful without becoming source truth | No planned revisit |
| Prefer workflows before cards/hierarchy/concepts | Workflows answer a cross-file relational query structure alone cannot answer and prove the shared semantic machinery cheaply | Implemented; no revisit needed |
